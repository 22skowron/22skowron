# Welcome to my profile!

I am a student of **Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems** who is eager to continue learning Python. 
Currently, the main area of my interest is working with *data* with various dedicated Python libraries. 
Over the next months I want to dive deeper into a field of *Machine Learning*.

Feel free to check out my repositories!
